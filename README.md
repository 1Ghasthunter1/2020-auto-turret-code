This library uses a mix of Python as a control interface between a computer and USB tether to control a home-made auto turret running an arduino MEGA 2560 with two NEMA 17 steppers from a 3D printer as the axes controls.

In later revisions of the software (not on git), a self-attached raspberry pi would host a web-server, granting the user remote control access through a browser to control the turret.
